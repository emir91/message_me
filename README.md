# MESSAGE_ME

This is a chat application done in Rails 5.

You can register and than send message to your friends who are also registered.

I use ActionCable to implement real-time features in Rails apps.

Things that I have covered by doing this application are:

* Installation and usage different versions of Rails(in my previous app I have used Rails 6)

* Authentication system

* Web socket

* Semantic UI (for styling)
